        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>20 g grated ginger</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>4 tablespoons sugar</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>250 ml water</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Combine ingredients</h3>
        <p> In a large glass jar, combine the grated ginger, sugar, and filtered water.</p>
        <p> Cover the jar with a cloth or paper towel secured with a rubber band. </p>
        <h3>Fermentation</h3>
        <p>Place the jar in a warm, dark place (like a kitchen counter) and let it ferment for 3-5 days.</p>
        <p>After the initial fermentation, you can "feed" your ginger bug every 2-3 days. To feed it, add two tablespoons sugar and a glass of water.</p>
        <h3>Strain and store:</h3>
        <p>Once your ginger bug is bubbly and has a strong ginger flavor, you can strain it to remove the solids.</p>
        <p>Store the liquid in a sealed container in the refrigerator.</p>
        <h2>Using your ginger bug</h2>
        <p><i>Ginger beer:</i> To make ginger beer, mix your ginger bug with additional water, sugar, and lemon juice. Bottle the mixture and let it carbonate for a few days.</p>
        <p><i>Other fermented drinks:</i> You can use your ginger bug to ferment other fruits and vegetables, such as berries or cucumbers.</p>
