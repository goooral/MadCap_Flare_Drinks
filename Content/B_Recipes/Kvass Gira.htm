        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Combine ingredients</h3>
        <p>Cut the rye bread into small pieces and dry them in a toaster oven or a regular oven until they are crispy.</p>
        <p>Bring the water to a boil in a large pot.</p>
        <p>Add the dried bread to the boiling water and let it steep for 15-20 minutes.</p>
        <h3>Prepare the mixture</h3>
        <p>Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool completely.</p>
        <p> Strain the liquid to remove the bread pieces.</p>
        <p> Add sugar and yeast to the cooled liquid. </p>
        <p>Stir well to dissolve the sugar.</p>
        <h3>Fermentation</h3>
        <p>Transfer the mixture to a clean, sterilized container. </p>
        <p>Cover the container with a cloth or paper towel and secure it with a rubber band.</p>
        <p> Let it ferment at room temperature for 1-2 days, or until it becomes bubbly and slightly acidic.</p>
        <h3>Bottle and store</h3>
        <p>Once the fermentation is complete, strain the kvass to remove any sediment.</p>
        <p> Bottle the kvass and store it in the refrigerator.</p>
