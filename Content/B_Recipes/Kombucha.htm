        <h2>Basic ingredients (for one litre of kombucha)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> ~750 ml water</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>4 tablespoons of sugar</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>4 black/green tea bags (don't use herbal or fruit tea by itself, the caffeine in tea leaves is part of what feeds the yeast and bacteria)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>~250 ml kombucha starter (from a previous batch of kombucha or store-bought - if store-bought, it must be unpasteurized)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>1 SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast) - if you have one. If you don't, not a problem, SCOBY will appear in your kombucha over time.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also use additional tea, herbs, fruit or substitute part of the sugar content with fruit syrup, as long as it is sugar-based.</p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Brew the tea</h3>
        <p>Boil the water.</p>
        <p>Stir in the sugar until dissolved.</p>
        <p>Add the tea bags and any additional ingredients of your choice.</p>
        <p>Let the tea cool to room temperature.</p>
        <h3>Prepare the jar</h3>
        <p>Clean a glass jar thoroughly with hot water and soap or in a dishwasher.</p>
        <p>Rinse well and let it air dry.</p>
        <h3>Combine ingredients</h3>
        <p>Pour the cooled tea into the clean jar.</p>
        <p>Add the starter liquid and SCOBY.</p>
        <h3>Fermentation</h3>
        <p>Cover the jar with a breathable cloth or a paper towel and secure it with a rubber band.</p>
        <p>Place the jar in a warm, dark place (like a pantry or cupboard).</p>
        <p>Let it ferment for a few days, up to a week (if you're preparing a larger batch, let it sit for longer).</p>
        <p>Pour the kombucha to glass bottles. If some sugar remains and you keep the bottled kombucha stored in fermentation-friendly conditions for a few more days, your drink will carbonate.</p>
        <h3>Refrigerate and enjoy</h3>
        <p>Once the desired flavor is reached, refrigerate the kombucha to stop the fermentation process.</p>
        <p>Store in the refrigerator and enjoy within a few weeks.</p>
