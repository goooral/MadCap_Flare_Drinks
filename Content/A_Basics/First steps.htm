        <h1>First steps</h1>
        <p>This guide presents five recipes of different fermented drinks, which were selected in order to present a wide range of methods and processes in a condensed packaging. All of the chosen recipes utilize ingredients which can be easily accessed in most grocery stores. Individual items might be harder to find, appropriate tips and instructions will be included as needed.</p>
        <p>The most important piece of information in this guide is: <span>don't follow the instructions too closely</span>. As long as there is water, sugar and a fermenting agent such as yeast or bacteria, you will get a fermented drink as a result. You can experiment with substituting one type of fruit for another or add an additional ingredient to tweak or enrich the flavour. Naturally, there are limitations to substitution and additions, as some ingredients you may want to replace might be necessary for fermentation to occur, just like other ingredients you would consider adding might interfere with the process. Experiment, research, try new flavors.</p>
        <h2>Universal rules and guidelines</h2>
        <p>While the process differs between different kinds of drinks, some of its elements are replicable. This is a list of guidelines which will help you regardless of the recipe you pick:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Sanitize equipment</b>: Thoroughly clean and sanitize all equipment before and after each use. If you have a dishwasher, washing your equipment in high temperature will be enough for most drinks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Use fresh ingredients</b>: Carefully pick ingredients to ensure a good-tasting product. Fruit that has gone bad will behave badly during fermentation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Monitor fermentation</b>: Keep an eye on the fermentation process. Treat time brackets in all recipes as guidelines, not too strictly. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Don't substitute sugar</b>: Ingredients such as erythritol, xylitol, maple syrup or honey have various uses in different recipes, however in order to keep the fermentation going, stick to white or brown sugar. Otherwise, your yeast or bacteria might starve or weaken, halting the process or allowing mold to appear.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Warm conditions, no direct sunlight</b>: Conditions in which you keep your brews matter greatly. You need an environment in which yeast and bacteria will thrive.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Alcohol content is a given</b>: But not too large, unless you want it to be that way. In most cases drinks such as homemade kombucha and kvass/gira will contain anywhere between 0,5%-2,5% alcohol (however, the former is more likely than the latter).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Look out for mold</b>: The acidity of fermented products does plenty to keep mold away, but don't take it for granted. Keep an eye out for mold and if it appears somewhere in the container, discard the contents and sanitize the container carefully. <b>Do not, under any circumstances, drink anything that was in contact with mold!</b></p>
            </li>
        </ul>
